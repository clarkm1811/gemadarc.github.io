## The GEMADARC Mission
					
- To advance knowledge, research and discovery in fundamental physics by developing novel detectors that will improve the sensitivity of ton-scale DM and neutrino experiments.
- To increase knowledge and advance frontier physics education and training for undergraduate STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) majors, graduate students, post-docs, and early career faculty, and develop a diverse workforce in physics and engineering.
- To improve global collaboration on Ge related technology through integrative global partnerships, anchored by best-in-class research facilities, resources, and expertise.

## Visa

Participants should apply for L visa via their local Chinese embassy or consulate by providing their ordinary passport, visa application form, and other required documents. Information can be found online. For US students, please check [this page](http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/visas/hrsq/).

Please [register](https://goo.gl/forms/Z8obATHgnBI5s3vA2) as early as possible so that we can send you necessary documents for your visa application. There is no need to book the flight in advance since our invitation letter would work for visa application as well.

## Food

Breakfast will be provided by hotel. We highly encourage you to book lunch box and dinner provided by the local organizing committee to have save, convenient and delicious food. Tickets can be purchased on site one day before the school. Please indicate your food preference in our [registration form](https://goo.gl/forms/Z8obATHgnBI5s3vA2) so that we can prepare accordingly. We can provide information for your own food adventures on excursion days. It would be wise to have some local students in your adventure team.

## Lodging

![KeHua Hotel](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RHh3aKz9WrR6VPtVGZArP1hIkq1I0sMS)

We will be staying in the KeHuaYuan Hotel right on [SCU] campus from July 11 to 18.
Its address is

    No. 141,
    Ke-Hua North Road,
    Wuhou District,
    Chengdu, China

There is no need to make your own reservation as long as you [register online](#registration). Students are highly encouraged to share rooms. Foreign students will be mixed with Chinese students to increase culture exchange opportunities.

Lecturers will stay in the same hotel to maximize the chance for students to discuss with them.

## Transportation

Transportation between [SCU] and [CJPL] will be provided by local organizers, which is not included in the [registration fee](#registration).

Some local students may meet you in Chengdu airport if you need help to find your [way to the hotel](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/chengdu+airport/Kehuayuan+Hotel,+141+Kehua+N+Rd,+JiuYan+Qiao,+Wuhou+Qu,+Chengdu+Shi,+Sichuan+Sheng,+China). If that is the case, please [email the organizer](mailto:jing.liu@usd.edu) your flight information as soon as you have it.

## Financial assistance

PIRE GEMADARC provides some limited amount of [travel support](http://pire.gemadarc.org/education/#travel-support) for graduate students.

For students at [USD], please check <http://www.usd.edu/cage/study-abroad/financial-aid>. The link also include some general information on finding financial assistance.

## Culture and activities

In addition to two days of excursions, we offer you

- Culture show in banquet: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bian_lian>
- Morning [Tai chi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi) or [Qigong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong)
- Afternoon exercises: Basketball, soccer, swimming, jogging, tennis, and Kong fu in the beautiful [SCU] campus
- Early evening parties: Karaoke, [Mahjong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong), [Tea ceremony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_ceremony), Chinese movies, etc.

## Registration

The registration fee is \$160 US dollars for students outside of China, and 1,000 RMB for Chinese students. It is used to cover the following cost:

- coffee, tea, and snacks in between lectures
- a banquet and a [culture show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bian_lian) during the banquet
- two-days of [excursion](#excursion)
- a T-shirt and some stationaries with [PIRE-GEMADARC](http://pire.gemadarc.org/) logos

It can be paid on site on July 11 by cash. The online payment option will be available soon.

No deadline is set for registration at this moment. However, please fill [this registration form](https://goo.gl/forms/Z8obATHgnBI5s3vA2) (outside of China) at your earliest convenience so that

1. We can have a rather accurate head counts in an early stage for better preparation (Registration fee is not required for filling the form).
2. We can provide necessary documents for participants outside of China to start their [visa](#visa) application processes.

Please be cautious about purchasing air tickets before obtaining a Chinese [visa](#visa). A round trip ticket from US to China in July at this moment costs about \$1,200, and will be quickly approaching \$1,500.

**Please note that the registration process and fee are NOT waived for lecturers.** They need to fill the [form](https://goo.gl/forms/Z8obATHgnBI5s3vA2) and pay the registration fee as well. However, lecturers from outside the PIRE-GEMADARC collaboration may receive lecturing fees as compensation.

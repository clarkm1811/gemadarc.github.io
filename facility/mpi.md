# The Max-Plank-Institute for physics operates three facilities to investigate germanium detectors:

# Galatea

![Galatea](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0BwM7XYhFgK7oYUppM2VhQndFakk)

Galatea is designed to allow detector scans with alpha, beta and gamma sources. A system of three stages is located inside a vacuum tank. The infrared shield of the detector has slits along which the collimated sources can be moved. As the infrared shield can be rotated, complete mantle scans are possible. Currently work is ongoing to fullu automate Galatea.

Galatea is mainly used to study surface events. 

# K2

K2 is designed to allow detector scans with gamma sources. A system of three stages surrounding a temperature controlled vacuum cryostat makes complete mantle scans possible. The system is fully automated. Currently work is ongoing to upgrade K2 with a Compton camera to allow for 3d scans.

K2 is mainly used to study drift paths patterns and the temperature dependence of pulse shapes.

# Gerdalinchen II

Gerdalinchen II features a small cryogentic vessel which can be filled with liquid argon or nitrogen. Germanium detectors can be submerged in a controlled way avoiding icing. 

Gerdalinchen II is mainly used to study the behaviour of detectors when directly submerged in cryo-liquid.

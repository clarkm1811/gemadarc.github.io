# Coherent Elastic &nu;-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS)

A bullet can distroy an apple, while a billiard ball can only strike another without tearing it apart. This difference is caused by the difference in the energies of the incident objects. A very energetic incident object tends to interact with only a small part of the target, while a less energetic one tends to interact with the target as a whole.

Similarly, a high energy neutrino, &nu;, tends to interact with individual nucleons in a nucleus, while a low energy &nu; can interact with a nucleus as a whole. The latter process is called the Coherent Elastic &nu;-Nucleus Scattering, or CEvNS in short.

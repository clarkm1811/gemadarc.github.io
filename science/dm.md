# Dark matter
There seems to be a lot more in the universe than can be seen. The normal matter that "our world" is made of seems to be only a small part of it. The first indication that the observed matter is not enough came from the study of galaxy clusters: there apparantly is not enough matter to hold them together. They move about so fast that the clusters should have dispersed. Then came the observation that the stars at the edges of large spiral galaxies move around their galaxies too fast. This indicated that these galaxies have very massive halos which are invisible, i.e. "dark".

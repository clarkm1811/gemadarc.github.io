# Dark matter
There seems to be a lot more in the universe than can be seen. The normal matter that "our world" is made of seems to be only a small part of it. The first indication that the observed matter is not enough came from the study of galaxy clusters: there is apparantly not enough matter to hold them together. The galaxies move about so fast that the clusters should disperse. Then came the observation that the stars at the edge of large spiral galaxies circle their galaxies too fast. This indicates that these galaxies have very massive halos which are invisible, i.e. "dark". An finally came the mapping of the dark masses with gravitational lensing.
In Einstein's description of gravity, any mass bends space-time. Thus, even the path of a massless particle like a photon, i.e. light, gets bent. This can result in observing the same object multiple times. 

The observation of multiple images of far away objects makes it possible to estimate the amount of mass between the far away object and us. Many observations have to be combinded to create a amap of the dark mass.

As we cannot see this dark mass, we call whatever it is made of "dark matter". Particle physics provides a couple of hypothetical candiates for dark matter. One of them is the "weakly interacting massive particle".

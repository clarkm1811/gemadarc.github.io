 # Neutrino Electromagnetic Interactions
Neutrino oscillation experiments provide compelling evidence on finite neutrino masses and mixings. It is expected anomalous neutrino electromagnetic couplings (Figure 1) can be expected to exist. The studies of neutrino electromagnetic effects [1] are promising avenues to probe these possibilities. 

Intrinsic neutrino properties such as magnetic moments (  $\mu_{\nu}$ ) [2], milli-charge ( $q_{\nu}$) [3] and charge radius ( $ \langle r_{\nu}^2 \rangle$ ) are the realizations of anomalous neutrino electromagnetic effects. Their experimental manifestations are the deviations of the integral and differential cross-sections in neutrino-atom interactions: 

$\nu + A  \rightarrow \nu + A^+ + e^- $

relative to those due to Standard Model electroweak processes. In particular, both $\mu_{\nu}$  and $q_{\nu}$ would lead to cross-section enhancement as well as distinct spectral features at low (<10 keV) energy transfer or equivalently the measureable energy in an interaction (Figure 2). 

Germanium detectors, with their low threshold and excellent energy resolution, are optimal in the studies of neutrino electromagnetic effects [4]. Some of the most sensitive results in these studies have been obtained from germanium detectors with reactor neutrinos. The expected improvement of the germanium technologies in detection threshold, energy resolution and intrinsic background in the course of the PIRE-GEMADARC program will further extend the sensitivity reach in these studies.
